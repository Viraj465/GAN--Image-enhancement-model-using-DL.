**Hybrid GAN Model** 

**Overview**
This repository contains a hybrid GAN model that combines the strengths of Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN) and Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). The primary focus is on image super-resolution, leveraging the capabilities of SRGAN while incorporating features from DCGAN for improved performance. Initally we took an high resolution image and decreased its resloution by adding artifcats,noise, blur and compressing the image and then applied the algorithm on it to see wheter we get back the exact same image.

**Project Details**
Training Duration: 3001 epochs
Reason for Limitation: Due to resource constraints, the training duration was limited to 3001 epochs.
